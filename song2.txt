Won't ever give up 'cause you're
Still somewhere out there
Nothin' or no one's gonna keep us apart
Breakin' it down but I'm still gettin' nowhere
Won't stop, hold on
Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin' excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
My love is rising the story's unwindin'
Together we'll make it 'n' reach for the stars
You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one
You're my only one
Thunder 'n' lightning, it's gettin'excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life .every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one
